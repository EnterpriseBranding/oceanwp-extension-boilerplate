# OceanWP Extension Boilerplate

A simple plugin boilerplate to fast-track your OceanWP extension development.

To get started: change the directory name, oceanwp-extension-boilerplate.php, languages/oceanwp-extension-boilerplate.po to reflect your new plugin name.

Then do some Find/Replace (case sensitive) across the entire directory:

* 'OceanWP Extension Boilerplate' => 'Your Extension'
* 'OceanWP_Extension_Boilerplate' => 'Your_Extension'
* 'oceanwp-extension-boilerplate' => 'your-extension'
* 'oeb_' => 'ye_'
* 'oeb-' => 'ye-'

That's it! Start building!
